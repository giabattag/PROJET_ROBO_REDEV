2ω⊗q(3) ̇ω=I−1τ+I−1(ω×Iω)(4)Question 1.2.1Explain why multirotor UAVs are currently limited in takeoff weight to several hundredkilograms, while planes can lift hundreds of tons and helicopters can lift dozens of tons.Question 1.2.2Write an expression of the force and torque exerted onFBby a propeller.1.3    Quadrotor ControlThere is a wide array of litterature available on the control of quadrotors, using many of thecontrol methods you have learned in various classes, such as PD, PID, feedback linearization,sliding mode, optimal control, and much more.  Most quadrotor systems, such as the popularopen source PX4 flight stack1use a cascading control architecture (often reffered to as ”back-stepping”) to control the desired states of the quadrotor.Question 1.3.1We typically consider the quadrotor state to bex= [p,ψ]∈R4as it is useful for most1https://dev.px4.io/master/en/concept/architecture.html2
